# üìñ  API Notes - User Manual


---
### üöÄ Model Design

This section describes the main models in the application and their relationships.

#### User Model

*   Stores customer information, including OpenID Connect (OIDC) identifiers.
*   Key Fields: `role`, `email`, `phone_number`, `oidc_identifier(openid_sub)`
*   **Note:** Customers must have a phone number to complete their profile.

#### Category Model

*   Represents product categories, supporting up to three levels of nesting.
*   Key Fields: `name`, `parent_category`
*   **Average price calculations** are limited to three levels to maintain performance and relevance.

#### Product Model

*   Stores details about each product.
*   Key Fields: `name`, `price`, `category`, `stock``,discount_price`

#### Discount price field is meant to account for price changes in case of discounts

#### Order Model

*   Tracks customer orders.
*   Key Fields: `customer`, `status`, `created_at`, `total_price`
*   **Status Workflow:**
*   `PENDING` ‚Üí Stock is not deducted yet, awaiting admin approval.
*   `COMPLETED` ‚Üí Stock is deducted after admin approval.
*   `CANCELED` ‚Üí Order is rejected (e.g., due to insufficient stock), and the customer is notified.
*   **Stock is deducted only upon admin order approval.**
*   #### OrderItem Model
    
*   Represents individual items within an order, capturing details like product, quantity, and price at the time of purchase.
*   **Key Fields:** `order`, `product`, `quantity`, `price_at_time_of_order`
*   **Business Logic:**
    *   Ensures `quantity > 0` when saving the record.
    *   The `price_at_time_of_order` is captured to prevent future price changes from affecting past orders.

#### Notification Model

*   Logs all customer and admin notifications (email/SMS).
*   Key Fields: , `message`, `created_at`

--- 

## üì¶ Order Processing

Order processing in this application ensures a streamlined workflow from placement to completion while maintaining transparency and efficient communication with both admins and customers.

#### 1\. Customer Places an Order ‚Üí Status: `PENDING`

*   The system **checks stock availability** for all ordered items.
*   The order status is initially set to `PENDING`.
*   **Stock is NOT deducted yet**‚Äîit remains reserved, awaiting admin approval.
*   **Admin is notified** via email about the new order.
*   **Customer is notified** of the order placement via sms.

#### 2\. Admin Reviews & Approves the Order ‚Üí Status: `COMPLETED`

*   Once the admin approves the order, **stock is deducted** from the inventory.
*   The order status is updated to `COMPLETED`.
*   **Customer is notified** via SMS about the order approval and completion.

#### 3\. (Optional) Order Cancellation ‚Üí Status: `CANCELED`

*   If the admin rejects the order (e.g., due to insufficient stock or invalid details), the order is **marked as `CANCELED`**.
*   **Customer is notified** of the cancellation via sms.

---

## üöÄ Notifications

### Overview

The notification system is designed to keep stakeholders informed at key points during the order lifecycle. Notifications are sent through **Email** and **SMS** channels to ensure timely communication.

*   **Email Provider**: Google SMTP
*   **SMS Provider**: Africa's Talking

Notifications are logged in the `Notification` model for tracking purposes.

* * *

### Notification Triggers

Below are the scenarios that trigger notifications, the notification type, and the intended recipients:

| Trigger | Notification Type | Recipient |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Order placed | Email | Admin |
| Order placed | SMS | Customer |
| Order approved | SMS | Customer |
| Order cancelled | SMS | Customer |

* * *

### Notification Examples

#### 1\. Order Placed Notification

*   **To Admin (Email)**
    
    *   "A new order (#123) placed for [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) requires your attention."
*   **To Customer (SMS)**
    
    *   "Hello +254711223344 your order #123 has been placed successfully."

#### 2\. Order Approved Notification

*   **To Customer (SMS)**
    *   "Good news, +254711223344! Your order #123 has been approved."

#### 3\. Order Cancelled Notification

*   **To Customer (SMS)**
    *   "Sorry, +254711223344. Your order #123 has been cancelled."

* * *

### Note

All notifications are tracked and logged in the `Notification` model, including the message content and timestamp for auditing purposes.

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### Overview

This application provides a RESTful API for managing orders, products, and categories. Below is a summary of the available endpoints:

* * *
### üîπ Authentication

**Root API Endpoint:** `api/v1`

#### Customer Authentication Endpoints

These endpoints manage authentication for customers using **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**.

*   **Login with OIDC:** `POST /api/v1/oidc/authenticate/`  
    _Initiates the OIDC authentication process and redirects to the identity provider._
*   **OIDC Callback:** `GET /api/v1/oidc/callback/`  
    _Handles the callback from the identity provider and processes the authentication response._
*   **Check Profile Completion:** `GET /api/v1/update-profile/`  
    _Redirects the customer to update their profile if any required fields (e.g., phone number) are missing._

#### Admin Authentication Flow

*   Admins use the **Django Admin Interface** for authentication and user management.  
    Access the admin panel at: `/admin/`

### üîπ Orders

*   **List Orders**: `GET /api/orders/`
*   **Create Order**: `POST /api/orders/`
*   **Retrieve Order**: `GET /api/orders/{id}/`
*   **Update Order Status** (Admin only): `PATCH /api/orders/{id}/`
*   **Delete Order**: Not allowed.

* * *

### üîπ Products

*   **List Products**: `GET /api/products/`
*   **Create Product**: `POST /api/products/` (Admin only)
*   **Retrieve Product**: `GET /api/products/{id}/`
*   **Update Product**: `PUT /api/products/{id}/` (Admin only)
*   **Bulk Upload Products**: `POST /api/products/bulk-upload/` (Admin only)  
    _See detailed explanation below._

#### üõçÔ∏è Bulk Upload Products

*   **URL:** `/api/products/bulk-upload/`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Description:** Allows admins to upload multiple products at once using a CSV file.

##### Example Request:

    POST /api/products/bulk-upload/
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data
    File: products.csv
    

##### Example CSV Format:

    name,stock,price,category
    Product1,10,100,Category1
    Product2,20,200,Category2
    

##### Example Response:

    {
      "products_created": 2,
      "errors": []
    }
    

##### Notes:

*   Only CSV files are supported for now.
*   Each row in the CSV represents a product with fields: `name`, `stock`, `price`, `category`.
*   If there are errors, the response will indicate which rows failed.

* * *

### üîπ Categories
*   **List Categories**: `GET /api/categories/`
*   **Calculate Average Price (up to Three Levels)**: `GET /api/categories/<id>/calculate_average_price/`  
    _See detailed explanation below._

#### üìä Calculate Average Price

*   **URL:** `/api/categories/<id>/calculate_average_price/`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Description:** Calculates and returns the average price of products for the selected category, including products in **immediate subcategories** and **nested subcategories up to three levels deep**.

##### Example Response:
```
    (
        {

        ¬†"category": Electronics,
        
    ¬† ¬† ¬† "average_price": 500,
    
    ¬† ¬† ¬† "products_count": 3,
    
    ¬† ¬† ¬† "subcategory_count": 2, ¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  },

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†status=status.HTTP_200_OK,

¬† ¬† )
```
    
#### Business Logic & Category Structure

*   The calculation includes **main category**, **subcategories**, and their **immediate children** (i.e., up to **three levels deep**).
*   **Why only three levels?** Aiming for a balance between performance and relevance:
    *   Two levels deep captures enough data for accurate calculations without including deeply nested categories that might distort the results.
    *   Ensuring that our queries remain **performant and scalable** while providing **accurate insights** for related categories.
*   **Going beyond three levels** introduces data from potentially unrelated or niche subcategories with significantly different pricing, which can skew the average.

##### Example:
Electronics  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Laptops (level 1)  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gaming Laptops (level 2)  
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ High-End Gaming Laptops (level 3) ‚Üê Included in the calculation  
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ultrabooks (level 2)  
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lightweight Ultrabooks (level 3) ‚Üê Included in the calculation  

**Categories beyond level 3** (e.g., `Premium High-End Gaming Laptops`) will not be included in the average calculation.

##### Notes:

*   This endpoint calculates the **average price per subcategory**.
*   Useful for tracking pricing trends and insights at a more specific level.

### üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

*   Support for JSON file uploads in bulk product upload.
*   Integrate background tasks for periodic category-level price analysis.

## üöÄ Permissions and Authentication

This application enforces strict role-based access control using custom permissions and authentication via **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**, with Google as the provider. The following section explains how authentication is handled and how permissions are enforced for different endpoints.

---

## **Authentication Overview**

The application uses the **mozilla-django-oidc** library for OIDC authentication. This enables users to authenticate via Google. All endpoints are secured with the `IsAuthenticated` permission, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the system beyond basic read-only actions (like viewing products).

### üîê Authentication Flow

### Customers: OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Customers are authenticated using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for a seamless and secure login experience. The flow ensures that customer profiles are complete before accessing protected resources.

1.  **Login with OIDC:**  
    Customers are redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication.
    
2.  **Callback and Token Handling:**  
    Upon successful login, the system processes the returned OIDC tokens to authenticate the user.
    
3.  **Profile Validation:**
    
    *   After authentication, the system checks if the customer's profile contains a valid **phone number**.
    *   **If the phone number is missing**, the user is redirected to the **Update Profile** page to complete their details before proceeding. The phone number is important for enabling sms notifications for customers.
4.  **Access Granted:**  
    Once the profile is complete, the customer can access the application‚Äôs full set of features.
    

### Admin: Standard Django Authentication

Admins use the default **Django Admin authentication** for login and management tasks. This ensures that admins have full access to manage the system securely.

*   Admins can log in through the `/admin` endpoint.
*   Permissions are set up to restrict access to sensitive resources based on the admin's role.
*   The admin panel provides full control over categories, products, orders, and user management.

#### **Default Authentication Classes**
The following authentication classes are configured in `settings.py`:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'mozilla_django_oidc.contrib.drf.OIDCAuthentication',  # Core OIDC Authentication
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',  # for web-based sessions
    ),
}
```
- **OIDCAuthentication:** Verifies user identity via Google OpenID Connect.
- **SessionAuthentication:** Supports browser-based sessions for authenticated users.

--- 


## Permissions Overview
Permissions are managed using custom classes to ensure appropriate access based on user roles. Below is a breakdown of permissions for each resource:

#### Orders
- **Customers:**
  - Can create new orders.
  - Can view only their own orders.
  - Cannot update or delete any order.
- **Admins:**
  - Can view all orders.
  - Can update the status of an order using the `PATCH` method.
  - Can approve and cancel orders.
  - Cannot delete or modify other order details.
  

#### Products
- **Customers:** Read-only access to product information.
- **Admins:** Full access to create, update, and delete products. **NB**: can only edit product details like price and stock

#### Categories
For **Admins** only
- Can create and edit categories.


### **Permission Classes**

I have implemented custom permission classes to enforce fine-grained access control. Here‚Äôs an overview of the key permission rules:

1. **`IsAdminOrReadOnly`**
   - **Read-Only Access:** Available to all authenticated users.
   - **Modification Access:** Restricted to admin users.

2. **`IsOrderOwnerOrAdminWithLimitedUpdate`**
    - **Customers:** Can create and only access their own orders.
    - **Admins:** Can view all orders and update the status using the `PATCH` method, but cannot delete or full modify order details(`PUT` operations).
    - Used for managing **orders**.

#### Implementation:
    ```python
    from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, SAFE_METHODS
    
    class IsAdminOrReadOnly(BasePermission):
    """Allow read-only access for everyone, but only admins can modify resources."""

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        # Allow read-only access for everyone
        if request.method in SAFE_METHODS:
            return True

        # Only authenticated admins can modify resources
        return (
            request.user.is_authenticated
            and hasattr(request.user, "role")
            and request.user.role == User.ADMIN
        )

    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        # Ensure the user is authenticated and has a role attribute before checking
        if (
            request.user.is_authenticated
            and hasattr(request.user, "role")
            and request.user.role == User.ADMIN
        ):
            return True

        # Deny all other modifications
        return False

    ```
### Usage
- The custom permission classes are applied in the corresponding viewsets.

**Example for Orders:**
```python
class OrderViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Order.objects.select_related('customer').prefetch_related('order_items__product').all()
    serializer_class = OrderSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsOrderOwnerOrAdminWithLimitedUpdate]
```

**Example for Products:**
```python
class ProductViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, IsAdminOrReadOnly]
```

---

### **Examples of Permission Enforcement**

#### **Product Endpoints:**
- **GET /products/** ‚Äì Any authenticated user can view the product list.
- **PATCH /products/{id}/** ‚Äì Only admin users can modify product details (e.g., price, stock).
- **DELETE /products/{id}/** ‚Äì Only admin users can delete a product.

#### **Order Endpoints:**
- **GET /orders/** ‚Äì Admin users can view all orders, while customers can only view their own orders.
- **PATCH /orders/{id}/** ‚Äì Admin users can modify order status; customers cannot modify any order.

---

### **Common Scenarios and Expected Behavior**
- **Authenticated Customer Viewing Products:** Allowed.
- **Customer Attempting to Modify a Product:** Denied (`403 Forbidden`).
- **Admin Modifying Product Price and Stock:** Allowed (`200 OK`).
- **Unauthenticated User Accessing Any Endpoint (Except Login):** Denied (`401 Unauthorized`).

### **Test Coverage**
The following tests ensure that permissions are correctly enforced:
- **Admin Access:** Ensure admins can modify and delete products.
- **Customer Restrictions:** Ensure customers can only view products and orders they own.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** Ensure unauthenticated users are denied access.

Example Test for Admin Access:
```python
@pytest.mark.django_db
def test_admin_can_update_product(user_admin, product_factory):
    client = APIClient()
    product = product_factory()
    client.force_authenticate(user=user_admin)

    response = client.patch(
        reverse('product-detail', args=[product.id]),
        {'price': 200, 'stock': 50},
        format='json'
    )
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK
    product.refresh_from_db()
    assert product.price == 200
    assert product.stock == 50
```
